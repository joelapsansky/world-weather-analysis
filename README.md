# World Weather Analysis
For this analysis, I collected data by using NumpY to generate random latitudes and longitudes.  Using citipy, I was able to acquire the nearest cities to those coordinates.  From there, using APIs and parsing JSON data, I built new data frames with relevant filters on temperature.  I also created a series of visuals like the ones you see below that show mapped out vacation routes, and possible vacation locations based on user preferences.  These visuals were created by API calls to open weather and Google.  This comes in handy when trying to create familiar visuals right in jupyter notebooks.
